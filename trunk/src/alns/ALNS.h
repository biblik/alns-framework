 * \class ALNS.
 * \brief This class contains the ALNS logic.
 *
 *
 * This class contains the logic of the ALNS (Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search).
 * The general idea of the ALNS is to iteratively destroy then repair a solution
 * to improve its quality. Non improving solution may be accepted as the new current
 * solution according to some acceptance criteria.
 * If you are interested about the general functionning of this method please refer to:
 * S. Ropke & D. Pisinger. An Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search Heuristic for Pickup
 * and Delivery Problem with Time Windows. Transportation Science, 40 (2006) 455-472.
